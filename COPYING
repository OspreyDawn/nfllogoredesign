What is NFL Logo Redesign
-------------------------

This is a series of logo redesigns that Max O'Brien has worked over the last few months. Max initially did the NFL team logo redesigns out of procrastination and shared them with the NFL subreddit on Reddit.com. The response was so positive he decided to use to opportunity to learn, learn more about the NFL history and practice his graphic design skills.

For a description and motivation for the project please refer to the post [The NFL, Redesigned](http://www.ospreydawn.com/blog/2013/09/16/nfl-redesign/) on [Max's portfolio site](http://www.ospreydawn.com/).
