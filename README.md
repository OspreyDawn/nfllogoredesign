What is NFL Log Redesign
--------------------------

This is a series of logo redesigns that [Max O'Brien](http://www.ospreydawn.com/) (aka. [Osprey Dawn](http://www.ospreydawn.com/)) has developed. Max initially did the NFL team logo redesigns out of procrastination and shared them with the NFL subreddit on Reddit.com. The response was so positive he decided to use to opportunity to learn, learn more about the NFL history and practice his graphic design skills.

For a description and motivation for the project please refer to the post [The NFL, Redesigned](http://www.ospreydawn.com/blog/2013/09/16/nfl-redesign/) on [Max's portfolio site](http://www.ospreydawn.com/) or below.

The NFL, Released
-----------------

The NFL Logos in this project were released to the world in September 2013. A effort to redeign all the NFL team logos [I had undertaken in my spare time over 5 months](http://www.ospreydawn.com/blog/2013/09/16/nfl-redesign/). Since then they've been retweeted, shared and blogged all over the web. The response from fans was overwhelmingly positive. Of course there were a few out there who didn't like them at all but more often than not they liked all of them but their own team. 

Those people, from the responses I read had valid criticisms which will probably inspire me to go back and give some of them another go. Fellows in the design world also had some valid visual critiques that I had thought might arise. All in all they're not perfect and I'm aware of that but with each attempt I make I can only get better. 

Then there was the extreme; some people were flat out offended that I attempted to change their team's beloved logos and that's fine. I just wished more people realised that this project was not to say I think they should be changed, rather it was just a fun exercise for fun's sake. But it's to be expected and I always find such uproars comical.

I've also been contacted by wide range of people regarding work and I'd just like to point out here that yes I have received your email and I will respond to it in due time. I have quite a bit on my plate at the moment with my current job and I have to figure out how to manage it all; I'm pretty new to all of this so please forgive my slowness. 

I have also been asked if I will do other sports leagues logos like the NHL or NBA and to that I have to answer no, I will not. That is not to say I'm not interested and I might at some point in the future but I do more than just logos. I make games, design user experiences and interfaces and even design research - [checkout my portfolio](http://www.ospreydawn.com/). If there's anything I do that related to sports logos in the near future it will most likely be in the form of redesigned NFL uniforms to go with the logos I have already done.

By far one of the most common queries has been with regards to memorabilia (hats, t-shirts, tattoos etc.).Being that these are logos inspired by the NFL I'm hesitant to push for commercial gain with these logos but at the same time seeing what I've done on some shirts would be pretty cool. With that in mind I'm releasing the project files in various formats (SVG, PDF, PNG, AI) for people to edit and use for their own means. 

Want a t-shirt with the Patriots logo I made? Download the logo and use it for one of the many custom t-shirt outlets I know there are online. One thing to mention though, all of these logos are under a Creative Commons License By Attribution, Non-commercial, Share Aaike. What this license allows you to do is freely use and modify any of the logos I have made anyway you'd like - fantasy logos, school teams, dorm emblems you name it - as long as its not for direct commercial use. All I ask in return is you attribute me (a link to my site for example) and share any modifications under the same terms.

If you're familiar with Git, the version control tool used by software developers, I've set up the entire set of logos on Github. In the future any modifications will be updated via Github and of course you can also send me git pull requests.  

I'm a fan of the NFL and that is why I did these logos, so more than anything I'd love to see how other fans use or modify what I've done. That is why I'm releasing the original files. So if you do use these in anyway please let me know. Send me a photo of what you've done with it or if its digital send me a link to it. I may feature a few of my favourite renditions in a blog post in the future.

Other than that, go wild.
